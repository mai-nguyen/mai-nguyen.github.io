	<h1>About me</h1>
      
  <p>I studied statistics at Oregon State University (Corvallis, Oregon) were it drizzles with cold water on average 162 days per year and now I live in Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam). While in college, I took on my first professional job as a receptionist at OSU International Student office, which lasted for 5 years. After that, I worked as a teaching and research assistant in the Statistics Department, and then an analyst for the Student Affairs Research unit, also at OSU. I am interested in using statistics and data analytics to improving human affairs such as education and human resource management.</p>
