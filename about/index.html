	<h1>About me</h1>
      
  <p>I studied statistics at Oregon State University (Corvallis, Oregon) and now I live in Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam). While in college, I took on my first professional job as a receptionist at OSU International Student office, which lasted for 5 years. After that, I worked as a teaching assistant in the Statistics Department, and then an analyst for the Student Affairs Research unit, also at OSU. Currently, I am a Senior Research Analyst at the 5Rs Partnership, a Singapore-based management consultancy in the education sector. I am interested in using statistics and data analytics to help solve problems in education and in business.</p>
