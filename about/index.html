	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I began participating in the "gig economy" in high school through tutoring English, transcribing and translating (VN-EN) consumer interviews, and facilitating group discussions at the HCMC English Speaking Club. My first professional job (albeit still part-time) was with the International Student and Faculty Services (now <a href="https://internationalservices.oregonstate.edu/international-osu">Office of International Services</a>) at Oregon State University, which lasted for five years when I studied economics at OSU. After that, I worked for OSU Statistics department, teaching lab and recitation sections in undergraduate courses, mostly <a href="https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/soc/ecatalog/ecoursedetail.htm?coursenumber=352&subject=ST">ST 352</a> and <a href="https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/soc/ecatalog/ecoursedetail.htm?subject=ST&coursenumber=201">ST 201</a>.</p>

    <p>My current interests are in research methods, data visualization, and data analysis techniques.  You can find some of my past projects on this site.</p>
