	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I began participating in the "gig economy" since high school through tutoring English, transcribing and translating (VN-EN) consumer interviews, and facilitating group discussions at the HCMC English Speaking Club. My first professional job (albeit still part-time) was with the International Student and Faculty Services (now <a href="https://internationalservices.oregonstate.edu/international-osu">Office of International Services</a>) at Oregon State University. 
    </p>


    <p>Education-wise, I studied Economics and Statistics at Oregon State University. My interests are in research methods, data visualization, and data analysis techniques.  You can find some of my past projects on this site.</p>
