  <p>In this project, Watershed Properties is interested in entering the short-term rental (SRT) market in the United States since its clients, the property owners, seeing the rising popularity of internet booking services like Airbnb, are also curious about the profitability of this market. Watershed stakeholders want to know if it is possible to make a profit of $6,000+ in the first year after converting the long-term rental to SRT.</p>
