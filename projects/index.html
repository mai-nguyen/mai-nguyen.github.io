	<h1>Demo project</h1>
  
  <p>In this project, Watershed Properties, a property management company, is interested in entering the short-term rental (SRT) market in the United States since its clients, the property owners, are also curious about the profitability of this market after seeing the rising popularity of internet booking services like Airbnb. Watershed stakeholders want to know if it is possible to make a profit of $6,000+ in the first year after converting selected long-term rentals to SRT.</p>
  
  <p>The data and project requirements were obtained from Duke University through the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/excel-mysql">Excel to MySQL: Analytic Techniques for Business</a> Specialization. The data contain information such as location, property type, occupancy rate, monthly and nightly rental rates, the 10th and 90th percentile STR rates for similar property in the same location for 244 properties managed by Watershed (as of 2015). Watershed managers also provided the initial financial assumptions that were the basis for my recommendation. I created the following relational schema to assist my querying of the data using SQL:</p>
